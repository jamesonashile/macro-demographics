# Macro Demographics

A global dashboard for visualizing demographic structures, built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Supabase

This tool helps macro analysts:
- See color-coded world maps by demographic shape and dividend phase
- Track when countries enter key stages (e.g. pre-dividend, post-dividend collapse)
- View trade signals with positioning suggestions (long FX, bonds, equities, or avoid)
- Sort and filter all countries based on signal strength, policy quality, and risk
